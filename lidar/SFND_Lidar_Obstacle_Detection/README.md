This is the first project of the course for working with lidar output where a streaming pcd file is to be used for segmentation, clustering and boxing. 

## Building the source
Just create a build directory, and run the following commands. 

` $ cd build; cmake .. `

` $ make .. `

The output video would look like the one below.
