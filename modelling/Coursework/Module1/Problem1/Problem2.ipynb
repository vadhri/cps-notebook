    "\n",
    "Given the initial position $ (z_{1,0}, z_{2,0}) $, the trajectory of the car is determined by the direction vector $ \\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2) $ and the constant speed $ v $. Since the car moves along a straight line, it will not be able to reach an arbitrary position on the plane unless the destination lies on the line defined by the initial position and direction vector $ \\mathbf{r} $.\n",

    "- The car can only move along the line defined by $ (z_{1,0}, z_{2,0}) $ and the direction $ \\mathbf{r} $.\n",
    "- If the target position is not on this line, the car will not be able to reach it by following a straight-line trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification:\n",
    "The motion of the car is governed by the linear equations derived in part (a). Since these equations describe motion along a straight line, the car is constrained to this line, and it cannot make arbitrary turns or change direction without altering the velocity vector $ \\mathbf{r} $. Therefore, the car cannot reach every possible point on the plane; it is limited to the points lying on its trajectory line."
