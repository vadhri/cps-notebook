    "### (a) Mathematical Model of the FSM\n",
    "\n",
    "The Finite State Machine (FSM) can be modeled mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **States and Output:**\n",
    "   - The FSM has two states, $ q \\in \\{A, B\\} $.\n",
    "   - The output $ \\zeta $ is defined as:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\zeta = \\kappa(q) = \n",
    "     \\begin{cases} \n",
    "     1 & \\text{if } q = A \\\\\n",
    "     -1 & \\text{if } q = B \n",
    "     \\end{cases}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input and Sampling:**\n",
    "   - The input $ v(t) $ is sampled at a frequency of 2Hz, which translates to a sampling period $ t_s = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ seconds} $.\n",
    "   - At time step $ n $, the input is $ v[n] = v(n \\cdot t_s) $.\n",
    "   - The FSM state at time step $ n $ is denoted as $ q[n] $.\n",
    "   - The output $ \\zeta[n] $ is determined by $ \\kappa(q[n]) $, so:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\zeta[n] = \\kappa(q[n]) = \n",
    "     \\begin{cases} \n",
    "     1 & \\text{if } q[n] = A \\\\\n",
    "     -1 & \\text{if } q[n] = B \n",
    "     \\end{cases}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Transitions:**\n",
    "   - The FSM transitions between states based on the sampled input:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     q[n+1] = \n",
    "     \\begin{cases} \n",
    "     A & \\text{if } v[n] \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n",
    "     B & \\text{if } v[n] < 0.5 \n",
    "     \\end{cases}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) Output Change Every 1 Second\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the input signal:\n",
    "$\n",
    "v(t) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2 \\pi t)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling and Output:**\n",
    "   - The FSM is sampled at 2Hz (every 0.5 seconds), so the FSM output can change every 0.5 seconds, not every 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Desired Output Change:**\n",
    "   - To achieve an output change every 1 second, a new sampling device that samples at 1Hz can be introduced. This device will sample every 1 second from the 2Hz input, effectively downsampling the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation:**\n",
    "   - The new sampling device will combine every two samples from the 2Hz input into one sample for the FSM, which will then change its output every 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c) Simulation of the Physical System\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical system is described by the differential equation:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\dot{z} = -z + u\n",
    "$\n",
    "where $ u $ is the input controlled by the FSM, and $ y = z $ is the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulation Setup:**\n",
    "   - The input signal to the FSM is:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     v(t) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2 \\pi t)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - The FSM output $ u(t) $ will alternate between 1 and -1 based on the state determined by $ v(t) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System Response:**\n",
    "   - When $ u(t) = 1 $, the system will tend to stabilize at $ z = 1 $.\n",
    "   - When $ u(t) = -1 $, the system will tend to stabilize at $ z = -1 $.\n",
    "   - The state $ z(t) $ will oscillate between these two values due to the periodic nature of $ u(t) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expected Output Trajectory:**\n",
    "   - The output $ y(t) = z(t) $ will exhibit periodic oscillations, reflecting the alternating behavior of the FSM output $ u(t) $. The system's state will adjust to these changes, resulting in a periodic trajectory that oscillates between positive and negative values."
