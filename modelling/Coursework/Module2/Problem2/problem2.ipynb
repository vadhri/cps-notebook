    "1. **States**: The different states the machine can be in.\n",
    "   - In this case, the states are **A** and **B**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Alphabet (Σ)**: The set of possible inputs.\n",
    "   - Here, the input alphabet is {**0**, **1**}.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transition Function (δ)**: A function that takes a state and an input and returns the next state.\n",
    "   - From the truth table, the transition function can be defined as:\n",
    "     - δ(A, 0) = B\n",
    "     - δ(A, 1) = A\n",
    "     - δ(B, 0) = B\n",
    "     - δ(B, 1) = A\n",

    "4. **Start State**: The state where the FSM begins.\n",
    "   - The start state is **A** (as indicated by the arrow).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Accept States (Final States)**: The states that signify the successful completion of the machine’s operation.\n",
